# FPL Time-Series Analysis

The challenge of predicting the performances of athletes before they perform has become very appealing to fans and spectators, and as such Fantasy sports has become a huge past-time hobby for fans with this desire. The biggest sport in the world, football (soccer), is naturally also the biggest in Fantasy sports with Fantasy Premier League being the biggest platform today, having more than 9.1 million people around the world play the game in the 2021-2022 season. The aim of this research is to find a suitable machine learning algorithm that is capable of performing a time series analysis on each player in the Premier League in order to predict their performances in the next gameweek(s). The machine learning models in question will be a univariate ARIMA-model, an Ensemble Gradient Boosting-model (XGBoost), a Support Vector Machine-model (SVM) and finally a Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Network that will be state-of-the-art for predicting time series analyses. These models will be well suited for finding the degree of complexity that is required to make a valid prediction.
